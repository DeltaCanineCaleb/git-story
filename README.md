It's 3 AM. An official phone alert wakes you up. It says "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON". You have hundreds of notifications. Hundreds of random numbers are sending "It's a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.‚Äù

Admittedly, first you're conflicted at what was in front of you. Hundreds and hundreds of random numbers, all telling you to simply look outside, a very simple task. On the other hand, the phone alert telling you not to was official. Not from any app of yours, but straight from the government. You eventually decide that the government has some sort of sense to them (at least for this scenario), and that it's late anyway. Despite knowing it was 3AM, you just turn on your XBOX, fully ready to start playing basically any game you own as a distraction.

Before playing though, I snuck down to the dark kitchen to grab some snacks. I warmed up some leftover chinese food from dinner, and I could faintly hear the notifications coming from upstairs.
