It's 3 AM. An official phone alert wakes you up. It says "DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON". You have hundreds of notifications. Hundreds of random numbers are sending "It's a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.‚Äù

Admittedly, first you're conflicted at what was in front of you. Hundreds and hundreds of random numbers, all telling you to simply look outside, a very simple task. On the other hand, the phone alert telling you not to was official. Not from any app of yours, but straight from the government. You eventually decide that the government has some sort of sense to them (at least for this scenario), and that it's late anyway. Despite knowing it was 3AM, you just turn on your XBOX, fully ready to start playing basically any game you own as a distraction.

Before playing though, I heard my stomach growl and realized how hungry I was. I snuck downstairs to warm up the leftover pizza from yesterday's dinner. Even from downstairs, I could still faintly hear the hundreds of notifications coming from my phone. The microwave beeped, so I grab my pizza and a bottle of water then run upstairs. I texted my buddies and told them to get on to play some games, but none of them were awake yet. I started thinking, "what if one of them looked at the moon." Suddenly all the lights went out shortly then came right back. I was getting a little scared, but I just disregarded what had happen.
